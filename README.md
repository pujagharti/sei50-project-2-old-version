## Development process
The point was concentrated to present fetched data to the user.
 
The user interface was created using CSS styles.
 
<img src="./src/styles/searchbar.png" width="70%" />
 
Data has been split into types on different routes.
 
e.g. Breakfast route
 
<img src="./src/styles/breakfast.png" width="70%" />
 
Routes include the list of elements with the single link address to the item.
 
## Challenges
 
The challenge was to manage the data from API as the API itself was really complicated. And also working on pair, we were encountered GIT issues i.e push and pull (data).
 
## Wins
 
Complete the data management in 3 days timeframe.
